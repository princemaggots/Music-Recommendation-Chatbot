A chatbot designed to recommend a list of musical artists, based off of [AutoConcierge](https://github.com/Sambour/Concierge-bot/tree/main). It uses the s(CASP) system for reasoning, and communication between the user and s(CASP) is done through GPT-4.

This project was done as a final project for my Computational Logic class (CS 6374) at UT Dallas.

# Requirements
- The [s(CASP) system](https://gitlab.software.imdea.org/ciao-lang/sCASP)
- [OpenAI API for Python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python), as well as a configured [API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries#create-and-export-an-api-key).

# Usage
To run, use the command `python3 main.py`.
